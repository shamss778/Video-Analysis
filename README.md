# Video Analysis

A comprehensive project for analyzing and processing video data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

This project provides tools and utilities for video analysis, leveraging Jupyter Notebooks to create interactive and exploratory analyses of video content. The project is designed to handle various video processing tasks and generate insights from video data.

## Features

- **Video Processing**: Core functionality for handling and processing video files
- **Interactive Analysis**: Jupyter Notebook-based interface for exploratory data analysis
- **Visualization**: Built-in tools for visualizing video analysis results
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easily extensible for custom video analysis workflows

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamss778/Video-Analysis.git
cd Video-Analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` is available, install the core dependencies:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy opencv-python pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the desired notebook from the project directory

3. Run cells sequentially to perform video analysis

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
